# Email Verification Setup Guide

## üéâ What's New

The email verification feature is now fully functional! Users can verify their email addresses by clicking the "Send Verification Email" button on their profile page.

## üìß Email Configuration

### Option 1: Gmail (Recommended for Production)

#### Step 1: Enable 2-Step Verification
1. Go to your Google Account: https://myaccount.google.com/
2. Click on **Security** in the left menu
3. Under "Signing in to Google", enable **2-Step Verification**

#### Step 2: Generate App Password
1. After enabling 2-Step Verification, go back to **Security**
2. Under "Signing in to Google", click **App passwords**
3. Select app: **Mail**
4. Select device: **Other (Custom name)** ‚Üí Type "ProTrack"
5. Click **Generate**
6. Copy the 16-character password (e.g., `abcd efgh ijkl mnop`)

#### Step 3: Update Your .env File
```env
# Email Configuration (Gmail)
EMAIL_HOST_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=abcdefghijklmnop
DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL=your-email@gmail.com
```

**Important:** Use the App Password (16 characters), NOT your regular Gmail password!

### Option 2: Console Backend (For Testing)

If you want to test without setting up Gmail, the emails will print to your console/terminal.

In `settings.py`, the console backend is already configured:
```python
EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.console.EmailBackend'
```

When you click "Send Verification Email", the email content will appear in your terminal where the Django server is running.

## üöÄ How It Works

### 1. User Profile Page
- Users see their email verification status (Verified ‚úÖ or Not Verified ‚ö†Ô∏è)
- If not verified, a "Send Verification Email" button appears

### 2. Sending Verification Email
- User clicks "Send Verification Email"
- System generates a unique 64-character token
- Email is sent with verification link
- Success message appears: "Verification email sent to user@example.com"

### 3. Email Content
```
Hello John Doe,

Thank you for registering with ProTrack!

Please verify your email address by clicking the link below:

http://127.0.0.1:8000/accounts/verify-email/abc123...xyz789/

This link will expire in 24 hours.

If you didn't create an account with ProTrack, please ignore this email.

Best regards,
The ProTrack Team
```

### 4. Clicking Verification Link
- User clicks the link in their email
- System verifies the token
- Email is marked as verified
- Success message: "‚úÖ Your email has been verified successfully!"
- Badge changes from "Not Verified" to "Verified"

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Files Modified

#### 1. `accounts/views.py`
Added two new views:
- `send_verification_email()` - Generates token and sends email
- `verify_email(token)` - Verifies the token and marks email as verified

#### 2. `accounts/urls.py`
Added two new URL patterns:
```python
path('send-verification-email/', views.send_verification_email, name='send_verification_email'),
path('verify-email/<str:token>/', views.verify_email, name='verify_email'),
```

#### 3. `templates/accounts/profile.html`
Updated the "Send Verification Email" button to be a functional form:
```html
<form method="post" action="{% url 'accounts:send_verification_email' %}">
    {% csrf_token %}
    <button type="submit">Send Verification Email</button>
</form>
```

## üß™ Testing

### Test with Console Backend (No Gmail Setup Required)

1. **Start the server:**
   ```powershell
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

2. **Register or login to an account**

3. **Go to Profile page:**
   - Navigate to `/accounts/profile/`
   - You should see "Not Verified" badge

4. **Click "Send Verification Email"**

5. **Check your terminal** - You'll see the email output:
   ```
   Content-Type: text/plain; charset="utf-8"
   MIME-Version: 1.0
   Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
   Subject: Verify Your Email - ProTrack
   From: your-email@gmail.com
